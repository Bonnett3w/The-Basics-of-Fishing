    <h3 class="equipmenth"> Rod and Reel </h3>
    <p class="tackle_description"> 
      The device you use to cast your bait and reel in any fish you catch. There are three main types of this essential tool:       </p>
    <p class="tackle_description">
      Baitcaster: harder to cast but allows for great control over casting distance.
    </p>
    <p class="tackle_description">
      Spinning: Much better for beginners, overall the best rod and reel for a more casual fisherman, such as myself.
    </p>
    <p class="tackle_description">
      Fly: A much more unique style of the rod and reel combo. You cant cast as you would with the other combos, and instead use the weight of the line to cast the lure into the water
    </p>

    <h3 class="equipmenth"> Terminal Tackle </h3>
    <p class="tackle_description"> Terminal Tackle is anything that goes on your line that is not actually your bait.</p>

    <h3 class="equipmenth">Bait </h3>
    <p class="tackle_description"> Your bait is what you use to lure the fish to bite. You can use real bait such as worms, bugs, little fish, bread, deli meat, almost any form of food can work. You can also use the plethora of artifical lures that exist, from rubber worms to shiny flashy metal spoons.  </p>
    <p class="tackle_description"> The only thing that matters is that your bait, real or artificial, has a hook! Otherwise you won't be able to catch the fish. </p>
